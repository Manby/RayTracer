# RayTracer
A ray tracer written in Java that uses Phong's illumination model.

This project was inspired by an exercise in the Graphics module of my undergraduate Computer Science course, (found [here](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2122/Graphics/)), which I wanted to take further.

There are some sample renderings in the Gallery folder.
